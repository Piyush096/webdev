        <h3> Dr. P. P. Bhattacharya</h3>
        <h5>
          "Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man" -
          Swami Vivekananda Everyone comes in this world along with inherent
          qualities, but to express his qualities, needs education. Education is
          not only a knowledge of known subjects, but also development of
          character building, perfection in logic, power of memory,
          farsightedness, vision and decision, power and innovative imagination.
          With this guideline, students can stand at their own as a ‘complete
          man’. Asansol Engineering College was established in the year 1998
          with a mission to impart quality technical education matching the
          constantly changing global standards. The college is approved by All
          India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and is affiliated to
          Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (MAKAUT), West Bengal
          (Formerly known as West Bengal University of Technology). We have an
          excellent combination of industry professionals and academicians on
          our faculty, who provide a holistic view of the engineering operations
          to our students. The college has well qualified, experienced and
          dedicated faculty and supporting staff, state of art laboratories and
          workshop facilities. The college has a full-fledged Placement and
          Training Centre that has been able not only to place our college
          students in various national and multinational organizations, research
          and education institutions but also many students have been motivated
          for higher study in our country and abroad. Thus Asansol Engineering
          College has become one of the premier institutions in West Bengal with
          research centric facilities. The college encourages faculty members to
          acquire higher degrees, to publish papers/text books and participate
          in seminar/workshop/conferences to enhance the knowledge of faculty as
          well as students. Dr. Abdul Kalam said “Dream is not that what you see
          in sleep, but Dream is the thing which does not allow you to sleep”.
          Keeping this in mind together our faculty, staff and student always
          strive for an all-round development of students as a complete man and
          to achieve their goal.
